# Py-Dician's Grammar

## 1) Definitions

The Py-Dician language uses a few symbols to denote its values, operations and concepts. Those symbols are divided into three categories:
- signs;
- keywords;
- and literals.

### 1.1) Signs

Signs are symbols composed of a single non-alphanumeric character. They represent delimiters and operators, such as mathematical symbols.

```
left_parenthesis  = "("
right_parenthesis = ")"
plus              = "+"
minus             = "-"
multiply          = '*'
divide            = '/'
```

### 1.2) Keywords

Keywords are symbols composed of one or more alphanumeric characters â€” _words_, that is. They represent more complex operations and constructs or concepts. Those words are reserved for the language.

```
die_tag = [dD]
```

### 1.3) Literals

Literals represent values that are expressed in an explicit manner, such as whole numbers.

```
integer = ("0" | [1-9] [0-9]*)
```

Only things worthy of note are:

- `die_tag`: used in conjunction with numerical expressions to describe a _dice set_, i.e. one or more dice rolled together;
- `integer`: describes a non-negative whole number, i.e. a number equal to or greater than 0 (zero).

## 2) Grammar

The predicates and production rules of the language.

```
<roll_expression> ::= <math_expression>

<math_expression> ::= <add_or_subtract>

<add_or_subtract>            ::= <multiply_or_divide> <add_or_subtract_right_hand>
<add_or_subtract_right_hand> ::= <plus_or_minus> <multiply_or_divide> <add_or_subtract_right_hand>
                               | &

<multiply_or_divide>            ::= <positive_or_negative> <multiply_or_divide_right_hand>
<multiply_or_divide_right_hand> ::= <multiply_or_divide> <positive_or_negative> <multiply_or_divide_right_hand>
                                  | &

<positive_or_negative> ::= <plus_or_minus> <dice_set>
                         | <dice_set>

<dice_set>     ::= <value> <optional_die>
                 | <die>
<optional_die> ::= <die>
                 | &

<die> ::= die_tag <value>

<value> ::= <literal>
          | <parenthesized_expression>

<literal> ::= integer

<parenthesized_expression> ::= left_parenthesis <math_expression> right_parenthesis

<plus_or_minus>      ::= plus | minus
<multiply_or_divide> ::= multiply | divide
```
